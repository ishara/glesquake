GLES Quake Known Bugs and Limitations

+ Currently requires the Android TMobile G1, because it expects a keyboard with the exact configuration of the G1.
+ Currently cannot be built with the SDK / NDK. You have to build using the full Android porting platform.
+ Currently the HELP/ORDERING menu item automatically runs timedemo1. (Useful for benchmarking, not so great for
  playing games.)
