GLES Quake Known Bugs

+ Currently requires the Android TMobile G1, because it expects a keyboard with the exact configuration of the G1.
+ Currently cannot be built with the SDK / NDK. You have to build using the full Android porting platform.
+ Currently the HELP/ORDERING menu item automatically runs timedemo1. (Useful for benchmarking, not so great for
  playing games.)

(In other words, you have to install and build the whole Android platform before building Quake:)
