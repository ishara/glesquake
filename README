GLES Quake

This is a port of Quake to OpenGL ES and the Android platform.

See the file BUGS for known bugs and limitations.

Introduction

In order to run Quake on the emulator and/or an Android device, you must:

	1) Obtain the Quake Game Data Files
	2) Obtain the Software Nneeded to Nuild GLES Quake
        3) Build
	4) Install
	5) Run
	6) Uninstall Quake (this step is optional)

Obtain the Quake Game Data Files
--------------------------------

When id Software released the source code to Quake to the public under the GPL license, they did not
similarly release the game data. Therefore, in order to actually play gles Quake, you must somehow obtain
the Quake game data files. Two ways of doing this are:

1) Buy a copy of Quake for a personal computer, and copy the pak files that come with that version.
2) Download and install the shareware version of Quake.

The rest of these instructions, and the actual glesquake application, assume that you have installed the
shareware version of Quake and copied the pak0.pak file to the location
glesquake/quake/app/id1/pak0.pak in the glesquake source tree.

(Unfortunately I can't help you obtain a copy of the quake game data files. I will mention that the
original version of Shareware Quake was available for DOS machines, so you may have to install a DOS
emulator, and also that at one time id software made the shareware version of Quake available on their
ftp server. Beyond that, Internet search engines are your friend.)


Obtain the Software Needed to Build GLES Quake
----------------------------------------------

Currently GLES Quake is built using the full Android source tree, which can be obtained here:

http://source.android.com/download

Follow the instructions on that page to install and build a copy of the Android source tree. Once
you can do that, you will have installed the tools and libraries needed to build GLES Quake.


Building Quake
--------------

Build from the command line:

$ cd glesquake
$ make


Installing Quake
----------------

Quake is not installed by default. To install Quake you need to copy the Quake executable
files and data files to the device.

Quake needs about 20 MB of space to store its data files. Quake files go on an external
micro SD card (This is /sdcard/data/quake directory).

Using the device with a microsd card:

	Turn on phone, plug into your development PC/Mac using the supplied ADB cable.
	cd glesquake
	adb remount
	adb install $OUT/system/app/Quake.apk

Make sure your device is not mounted as an USB Storage Device:
    Press Home button on Phone
    Press Menu
    Select "SD card & phone storage
    Make sure "Use for USB storage" is unchecked.

Then install the Quake data files by executing this script:

	./setupdevice.sh

(Or if you prefer to store the Quake data files on a SD Card, use this script instead:)

	./setupdevicesdcard.sh

Using the emulator:

	You can use Quake with the emulator, but you have to create and mount an sdcard image.
	(Doing that is beyond the scope of this document.)
	Once you've started the emulator with a sdcard image you can follow the directions for
	a real device.


Running Quake
-------------

Turn on the device

Look for Quake in the Activities folder. Launch it as you would any other activity.
It will take up to thirty seconds to start running.

When Quake starts running it will display a console with some debug information, then
go into an "attract mode" loop.

Starting a game:

Press space bar to bring up the main menu.
The "Quake icon" should be next to the "Single Player" menu item. Press the
"Enter" button twice to start the game.

Controls:

The Quake controls are customizable, depending upon the settings of config.cfg,
but the defaults are:

Uninstalling Quake
------------------

Quake has to be uninstalled in two parts:
    a) the Quake.apk file
    b) the data files on the sdcard

Use the Phone UI to uninstall the Quake apk:

    Press Home Key
    Press Menu Key
    Select Settings
    Select Applications
    Selct Manage Applications
    Select Quake
    Press "Uninstall"

Make sure your device is not mounted as an USB Storage Device:
    Press Home button on Phone
    Press Menu
    Select "SD card & phone storage
    Make sure "Use for USB storage" is unchecked

Then run this script to delete the Quake files on the sdcard:

    cd $TOP/apps/Quake
    ./cleanupdevicesdcard.sh
